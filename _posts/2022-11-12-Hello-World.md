title: Hello World
---

I suppose it would be some kind of developer heresy if I didn't start out a new journey with a Hello World.  So hi, hello, welcome.  I have no grand plans on what I want to make this long term, but I am sure that over time it will all come together.  

For those of you from the future, this past week has been quite an adventure in the Twitter world and at this point who knows if it will still be here.  This reminded me of something [Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com/) says and that is "who owns your content".  If you don't host your own site and content you are renting, the original article is here [your words are wasted](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/your-words-are-wasted).  I have had this domain for a while and use it for a few personal things, but with Mastodon using domain verification it reminded me that I had an empty placeholder on github pages and it was time to do something with it.
