title: Velveeta Fudge
---

Tracking this one mostly for myself to remember how to make this each year.  It sounds weird, but it is surprisingly good and has the perfect amount of sweetness and texture.  That said here is the recipe.

Cookware |
---------|
9 x 16 pan, glass or metal doesn't matter |
Large mixing bowl |
Medium sauce pan |
Wisk |
Mixing spoon |
Parchment paper |

Ingredient | Amount |
-----------|--------|
Powdered Sugar | 32 ounces
Cocoa Powder | 1 cup
Velveeta Cheese | 16 ounces
Butter | 2 cups
Vanilla Extract | 2 tsp

Before doing anything with the ingredients line your 9 x 16 pan with parchment paper.  The paper should stick over the pan a good bit.  It wont stay put in the pan, that is fine, just center it in the pan and let it be for now.

Wisk the powdered sugar and cocoa powder in a large mixing bowl until they are fully blended.  If the bowl is only big enough to house these two ingredients you are going to have a bad time.  Make sure you use a bowl that is only about half full, because you will need to add the other ingredients to this later and stir it in.

Cut up the Velveeta and butter into cubes under 1 in size.  Add the cheese and butter cubes along with the vanilla into a medium sized sauce pan.  Heat over medium heat and stir ongoing until everything is mostly liquefied.  The cheese wont fully melt, but it should only have small stringy pieces left.  If there are any large chunks keep going.

Once fully melted, pour the liquid mixture back into the dry mix from earlier, and stir like crazy with a mixing spoon until the two are fully combined.  Don't lick the spoon yet, you may need that.  The mixture should be roughly the consistency between cake batter and peanut butter.

Now that you have completed fudge, pour the fudge mixture into the center of the 9 x 13 pan (with parchment).  The fudge should spread itself out evenly in the pan, if not spread it out with the mixing spoon.

Put the fudge pan into the fridge and let it set.  It will take at least 3 hours to set enough to cut cleanly, though you have to cut fast or it gets soft fast.  If possible give it at least 5-6 hours, or even better overnight, to set up.

Once set up take the fudge out and flip over onto a cutting board, remove the parchment paper, and place the parchment paper back into the pan.  Cut the fudge into roughly 1 in squares, and place back into the pan.

Changes to try:
- If you like nuts in fudge throw in some chopped up walnuts into the dry mix
- If you want a slightly harder fudge, reduce the Velveeta to 12 ounces.  This will make the fudge sweeter.
