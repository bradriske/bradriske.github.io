This is my hodgepodge of documenting the random things that I do and try.  So what does that entail, it will probably be a mix of home server stuff, leatherworking, electronics, general life, and maybe some development related items.  I may veer away from that and write about whatever feels right, so no promises.

Personally I am based out of San Tan Valley Arizona with my wife and 2 kids.  I work from home office as a senior software engineer for Microsoft in the CO+I division, but anything here is my own opinion and content.  

My wife likes to point out that I have about a 6 week attention span for hobbies in my life which means that I do and try a lot of things, some stick and some don't.  At no point in my life would I ever be consider myself an expert in things, and I have no intention of becoming one.  I have found in my life that trying, failing, and sometimes succeeding at many things has led to being able to fail less at other new things.  Fail often, fail fast, and learn from it.
